# drag-n-drop
Drag and drop using: Drag and Drop API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)

# My Journey To Building The App

* I read these docs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API
* Implemented some code but didn't fully understand it
* Used this tutorial to increase my understanding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDKVLRXhr78
* Built a drag and drop (image between two boxes) using above tutorial
* Found this tutorial https://codepen.io/retrofuturistic/pen/tlbHE
* Spent time looking at the JS (it's very different to the previous JS I looked at from the other sources)
* Made sure I understood how the new JS worked and implemented it with my list idea
* Published my drop 'n drag list here - https://amberwilson.co.uk/sites/dragndrop/
